PCB badge
!!Con West 2020, February 29th - March 1st, Santa Cruz, CA

This badge was inspired by Tom Verbeure's prototype
(https://github.com/tomverbeure/bangbangbadge).  Thanks to Tom for giving me
tips and tricks for using the Inkscape SVG2Shenzhen plugin (which you'll
need to build this), and for how to get it to produce output that you can
send to PCBWay.  The form factor was also inspired by Michael Welling's
Latch-Up 2019 badge (https://github.com/mwelling/latchup-badge).

As Tom noted during the conference, one of the explicit anti-goals of this
badge is to "do something electrically interesting" (despite that PCBWay did
flying probe tests of each badge!).  Instead, the goal is to show off that
you can use all this extremely precise manufacturing ecosystem in Shenzhen
for not just electronics, but also art.  The entire order of 250 badges cost
an astonishingly low $1.88 per badge, including shipping and bank fees.  Our
question: what else could you do with manufacturing capability this
inexpensive?
